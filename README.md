This is an example of bearer token authentication. 
I added a swagger to test this API's.

Run this app by clicking on "https" button. Register and after that login and get a token,
with this token you should Authorize and then after it you can add a product otherwise
this endpoint will return unauthorized. Without authorization you can only get products.

There is also reset password endpoint in order for user to change password if needed.
